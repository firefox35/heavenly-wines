Version Control

Deployment of Live Version from Github

The website was created using CodeAnyWhere editor and the code was pushed to a repository in GitHub called Heavenly Wines.

I used the following GitHub commands to push the code to the repository, every time a chance is made to the code. This is what they called version control. Its basically a backup version of your code if anything goes wrong.

git add - This command is basically saving your code

git commit -m "Commit Message"

git push

The live link can be found here - <https://firefox35.github.io/heavenly-wines/>

Clone the Repository Code Locally

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
From the menu on left select 'Pages'
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Branch: main
Click 'Save'
A live link will be displayed in a green banner when published successfully.
The live link can be found here - <https://firefox35.github.io/heavenly-wines/>
